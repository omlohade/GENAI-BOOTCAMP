# 01 – Foundations of AI, ML, DL & Generative AI

Before touching Generative AI, it is **critical** to understand what problem AI is trying to solve.

Most beginners jump directly into tools like ChatGPT without knowing:

- What AI actually is
- Why ML exists
- Why deep learning was needed
- Why GenAI is a breakthrough

Let's fix that.

## 🤖 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence is the idea of making machines:

- Think logically
- Learn from data
- Make decisions like humans

AI is a **broad umbrella**.  
Everything else (ML, DL, GenAI) falls under AI.

---

## 📊 What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning is a **subset of AI**.

Instead of hardcoding rules, we:

- Give data to a machine
- Let it learn patterns
- Use it to make predictions

Example:

- Spam vs Not Spam emails
- House price prediction
- Student pass/fail prediction

ML mainly works with **numbers**, not raw text.

---

## 🧠 What is Deep Learning (DL)?

Deep Learning is a **subset of Machine Learning**.

It uses:

- Neural Networks
- Multiple layers (deep networks)

DL is powerful when:

- Data is huge
- Patterns are complex
- Traditional ML fails

Examples:

- Image recognition
- Speech recognition
- Language understanding

---

## ✨ What is Generative AI?

Traditional ML & DL mostly **predict** something.

Generative AI **creates** something new.

Examples:

- Generate text (ChatGPT)
- Generate images (DALL·E, Midjourney)
- Generate code (Copilot)
- Generate music, videos, voices

Instead of predicting _yes/no_, GenAI learns:

> "How does human-like content look?"

---

## 🧩 Why GenAI Is Special

Earlier models:

- Needed structured numeric data
- Could not understand raw language

GenAI:

- Understands language
- Understands context
- Generates meaningful responses

This is possible because of:

- NLP
- Large datasets
- Transformers
- Massive compute power

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

You cannot master GenAI without:

- ML basics
- NLP understanding
- Vector representations
- Deep learning intuition

That's why this bootcamp starts **slow and strong**.
