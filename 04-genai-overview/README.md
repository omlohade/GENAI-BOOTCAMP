# 04 – Understanding Generative AI

Now we connect everything learned so far.

## 🔗 How Everything Fits Together

1. Python → Tool
2. NLP → Language understanding
3. Vectors → Machine-readable form
4. Models → Learn patterns
5. GenAI → Generate new content

## 🧠 Generative AI Workflow (Conceptual)

Text → Tokenization → Vectors → Model → Output Text

This pipeline exists in:

- ChatGPT
- Google Gemini
- Claude
- Copilot

## 🔍 Why GenAI Feels "Intelligent"

Because it learns:

- Context
- Relationships between words
- Patterns in language

It does NOT "think".
It predicts the **next best output**.

---

## ⚠️ Important Reality Check

GenAI:

- Can hallucinate
- Is not always correct
- Depends on training data

Understanding this makes you a **better AI engineer**.

## ✅ Key Takeaway

GenAI is powerful,
but only when you understand what's happening underneath.
