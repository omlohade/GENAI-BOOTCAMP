## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

Most GenAI courses rush through concepts or rely solely on videos. This bootcamp is different:

✅ **Self-contained learning** - Everything explained in the repository itself  
✅ **Clear fundamentals** - Build strong intuition before code  
✅ **Progressive structure** - Each chapter builds on the previous  
✅ **Practical focus** - Hands-on notebooks with real examples  
✅ **Visual aids** - Diagrams, tables, and flowcharts throughout  
✅ **Quick references** - Cheat sheets for revision

## 🎓 Learning Philosophy

### 1. Intuition First, Code Second

We explain **why** before **how**. Understanding beats memorization.

### 2. Progressive Complexity

Each chapter builds naturally on previous knowledge. No sudden jumps.

### 3. Visual Learning

Diagrams, tables, and flowcharts make concepts stick.

### 4. Practical Application

Every concept includes real examples and hands-on practice.

### 5. Self-Sufficient

No external videos needed. Everything is documented here.
