# 02 – Python Basics for Generative AI

Python is not taught here as a general programming language.

We learn **only what is needed** for:

- NLP
- ML
- GenAI pipelines

---

## 🐍 Why Python for GenAI?

Python is preferred because:

- Simple syntax
- Huge AI ecosystem
- Powerful libraries
- Industry standard

Almost every GenAI framework is Python-first.

---

## 📌 Python Concepts You MUST Know

### 1. Functions

Functions allow reusable logic.

GenAI pipelines heavily rely on:

- Preprocessing functions
- Data transformation functions

---

### 2. Lambda Functions

Used for:

- Quick transformations
- Cleaner code
- Functional programming style

Common in data processing.

---

### 3. Exception Handling

GenAI apps deal with:

- File uploads
- APIs
- User inputs

Your app **must not crash**.

That's why:

```python
try-except-finally
```

is critical.

---

### 4. File Handling

Used for:

- Reading datasets
- Saving embeddings
- Logging outputs

Text & binary files are both important.

---

### 5. Libraries Overview

You don't need mastery yet.

You just need to **know why they exist**:

- NumPy → numerical computation
- Pandas → data handling
- OS → file & path operations

---

## ✅ Key Takeaway

Python is a **tool**, not the goal.

We learn Python **only to build GenAI systems**.
